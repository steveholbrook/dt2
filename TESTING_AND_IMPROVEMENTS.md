3. Host: Mark task as complete
4. Host: Pause downtime
5. Host: Resume downtime

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Task appears in viewer within 1 second
- ‚úÖ Completion checkmark syncs within 1 second
- ‚úÖ Status changes to "Paused" (orange) in viewer
- ‚úÖ Duration stops counting in viewer
- ‚úÖ Status changes back to "In Progress" (red)
- ‚úÖ Duration resumes counting

**Timing Check:**
- All changes should sync within 1 second maximum
- No page refresh required

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Issue: Viewer Shows Blank Screen

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Open console (F12)
2. Check for: `Session snapshot received: {hasState: true}`
3. Check for: `üìä Viewer: Updating UI for active downtime`
4. Check for JavaScript errors (red text)

**Solutions:**
- If no snapshot: Firebase connection issue
- If no UI update log: updateViewerPanel() not running
- If JavaScript errors: Check error message
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+F5

### Issue: Multiple Hosts Not Blocked

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Verify downtime actually started (status shows "In Progress")
2. Check console for: `‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot become host`
3. Verify customer names match exactly
4. Check if both using same Firebase project

**Solutions:**
- Ensure Host clicked "Start Downtime"
- Verify customer parameter: `?customer=ExactName`
- Check Firebase rules allow write access
- Clear browser cache and retry

### Issue: Reset Not Working

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check if user is HOST (only host can reset)
2. Check console for reset logs
3. Verify Firebase permissions

**Solutions:**
- Must be in HOST mode to reset
- Check Firebase rules allow delete operations
- Try manual session deletion in Firebase Console
