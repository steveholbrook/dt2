# START HERE - Critical Fixes Package

## 🎯 What You Need to Know

Your Technical Downtime Tracking App has been fixed for **production-critical issues**:

### Issue 1: Multiple Hosts ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Multiple users could control the same session simultaneously, causing conflicts.
**Solution:** Only ONE host allowed during active downtime. Others automatically become viewers with clear notification.

### Issue 2: Blank Viewer Screen ✅ FIXED  
**Problem:** Viewers saw empty screen with no data or real-time updates.
**Solution:** Viewers now see everything - duration, timeline, progress, tasks - all in real-time.

## 🎬 How It Works Now

### Scenario: Starting a Session

**User A (First):**
1. Opens: `?customer=Acme&viewer=0`
2. No active session → Becomes HOST ✅
3. Starts downtime
4. Controls everything

**User B (Second):**
1. Opens: `?customer=Acme&viewer=0`
2. Active session detected → BLOCKED 🚫
3. Alert shown: "HOST MODE BLOCKED..."
4. Automatically becomes VIEWER
5. Sees everything but can't control

**User B sees in viewer:**
- ✅ Status: In Progress (red)
- ✅ Duration: 00:15:42 (counting up)
- ✅ Timeline: Red line moving
- ✅ Progress: 45% Complete
- ✅ All tasks visible
- ✅ Real-time updates

## 🎓 Tell Your Users

### For Hosts
"Only one person can control the session at a time. If someone else is already controlling it, you'll be automatically switched to viewer mode."

### For Viewers  
"You can watch everything in real-time but can't control the session. All changes made by the host will appear instantly."
